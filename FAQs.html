	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	<h3>So what is Collectiv anyway?</h3>
	Collectiv allows you to support the sites and content creators you love, by donating some of your computer's unused processing power.
	
	<h3>How am I helping?</h3>
	While you're browsing the internet, Collectiv uses a little bit of your extra processing power to do simple but repetitive calculations in the background. These are worth a small amount of money, which we automatically donate to the sites you select!
	
	<h3>Is it running?</h3>
	If the browser icon is colored (<img src="./Images/cent/icon16.png"/>), then Collectiv is running and you're good to go! If it's grey (<img src="./Images/cent/iconDisabled.png"/>), then Collectiv is paused, and you can restart by clicking "Resume Collectiv" in the drop-down menu.
	Collectiv is meant to run quietly and unobtrusively in the background, and doesn't require any interaction after you pick the sites you want to support.
	
	<h3>Are you harvesting my browsing data?</h3>
	No. We're not interested in your internet history, tracking you, or anything like that. We're just trying to make it easier to support the causes you care about.
	
	<h3>I can hear my computer fans, what's going on?</h3>
	This is normal. Because your computer is doing some extra work in the background, the fans may turn on to cool it down.
