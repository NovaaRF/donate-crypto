	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	<h3>So what is ThisApp anyway?</h3>
	ThisApp allows you to support the sites and content creators you love, by donating some of your computer's unused processing power to mine cryptocurrency on their behalf.
	
	<h3>Is it running?</h3>
	If the browser icon is colored (<img src="./Images/icon16.png"/>), then ThisApp is running and you're good to go! If it's grey (<img src="./Images/iconDisabled.png"/>), then mining is paused, and you can restart by clicking "Start mining" in the drop-down menu.
	ThisApp is meant to run quietly and unobtrusively in the background, and doesn't require any interaction after you pick the sites you want to support.
	
	<h3>How am I helping?</h3>
	While you're browsing the internet, ThisApp runs some extra calculations in the background, in a process called "mining." This is rewarded with the digital currency Monero (which can be traded for real $$) which we automatically donate to the sites you select!

	<h3>Is this Bitcoin?</h3>
	No, though both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a> are examples of Cryptocurrencies, which operate using a concept called the Blockchain. We've selected to mine Monero because it's optimized for regular desktop and laptop CPUs, which allows you to have a bigger impact than in ASIC-dominated currencies like Bitcoin.
	
	<h3>I can hear my computer fans, what's going on?</h3>
	This is normal. Because your computer is doing slightly more work in the background, the fans may turn on to cool it down.
